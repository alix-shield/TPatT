Welcome! 
Thank you for visiting the project repository for The People and the Text. 
This document contains useful information about the project. 

What are we doing? 
The People and the Text is collecting and studying the archives of Indigenous authors in Canada. We are doing this work to acknowledge the contributions of Indigenous authors that have often been neglected in the study of literary archives in Canada, due to colonial policies, systemic racism/biases, etc. This database will provide resources to both scholars and community members/general public who seek to learn more about Indigenous authors; it provides a counter-narrative to settler literary histories that often ignore Indigenous contributions; and it can provide a starting point for scholars who wish to pursue specific authors/works/themes further. The database provides a bibliography of Indigenous-authored texts, various types of media (including interviews with Indigenous authors), digital scans of original texts, and also biographies of key Indigenous authors. 

This project was funded through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council between 2015-2021 (but our work still continues!)
